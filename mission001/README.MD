# Mission 001
A diamond-mining vessel, one that departed from Namibia last week, has gone missing. Three days ago, the ship sent out a distress signal, and immediately dropped off the face of the Earth.
That is why you're here, Tracker. You see, we have reason to believe that Unnamed, the sisterhood partial to black diamonds and the most destructive branches of science, is planning an unthinkable act of ecoterrorism. We're fairly certain that the lost ship will lead us to Unnamed.
Listen closely, Tracker. We can no longer have this case hinging upon terrestrial limitations. If you and the satellite can't find the ship…well, let's just say that we're likely to lose more than precious cargo.
**We have received a distress signal from the diamond mining vessel Axel Mærsk. We believe the message indicates the ship's location. Radio interference has resulted in a signal which is difficult to decode. We know the signal to be exactly 16 bytes long, and contains no repeating characters.
