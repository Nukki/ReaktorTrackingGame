# Mission 003
Dawn has yet to break when you stride through the sleepy bazaar of Kungrad, Uzbekistan. Discreetly scanning this modest oasis in the rocky Central Asian desert, it takes you a good couple of curious glances from older salesladies to spot the tiny man in the back. His weather-beaten trailer is bending under the weight of dozens of plump cabbages.
The man is setting up an equally exhausted looking camping chair when he suddenly senses your stare. Expressionless, he holds your gaze while you walk over.

You: I hear the pipeline running under the village was repaired today.

Man: Yes, yes…gave the villagers a scare, those leaks. Came real close to an explosion - one more slip, and this town would have been done with.

You: You're welcome, Professor. You must know why I'm here. Why did Unnamed want your life?

Man: I figured it out. Why they've been taking all those diamond ships. To fund its development.

You: Fund what development, exactly?

Man: They have engineered a new kind of bioweapon, a fungus, really. One that kills and eats up all vegetation it touches. Soon, all of the world's flora, everything that keeps us breathing, will be gone.

You: Dear god.

Man: You haven't even heard the worst part. They have already started spreading it. The first target is the world's lungs, of course. Amazon rainforest.

**While flood danger varies slightly day-to-day through natural geological activity, a one-day change in excess on 1,000m3 is virtually always suspicious.
Using satellite data, you have identified 50 regions of forest where something fishy has been going on, and monitored soil levels in those regions for the past month. Your last mission is to analyze the soil levels to find suspicious one-day changes in flood danger and help exterminate the bioweapon.**
