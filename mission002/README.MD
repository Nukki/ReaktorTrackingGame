# Mission 002
Breathlessly, you climb on board the ominously quiet cargo ship, it's steely hull now torn open by the rocky teeth of the Curtis Island Shore. Making your way across the slippery deck, you give the door to the captain's quarters a soft push.
Scattered on the floor of the cabinet are several chipped diamond loupes, shards of what seems to have been a dusty bottle of whiskey, and stained sheets of sketch paper. Taking a tentative step into the dim cabinet, you squint to make out the rectilinear silhouette of a gaspipe.
The Turkmenistan–China gas pipeline, to be exact.
Even from where you are standing, it is easy to make out the red zigzag lines, eerily slashed over the joints of the pipeline.

**The Turkmenistan–China gas pipeline has been sabotaged, and it seems to be experiencing dangerous off-gassing at times of heavy load.
You have completed a month long satellite sweep of the entire pipeline using hyperspectral photography to detect potentially dangerous contaminants.
While the levels of any given contaminant vary wildly over time, the total level of all contaminants combined should remain within a standard deviation at all times.
The sketches you found show that Unnamed has been tampering with the pipeline. Your task is to figure out where - find the dangerous anomalies in the satellite readings and report them to the pipeline engineers.**
